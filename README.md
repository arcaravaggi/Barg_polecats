# Spatial and temporal trends in western polecat road mortality in Wales

Data and R scripts relating to the methods described in Barg A, MacPherson J, Caravaggi A (in press) Spatial and temporal trends in western polecat road mortality in Wales. *PeerJ*.

All polecat mortality data are available via Local Environmental Records Centres (LERCs). These centres often track requests and the destination of data, hence we have chosen not  to provide this data here as information on direct requests to LERCs would benefit the biodiverity records community.

Please contact Allison Barg (abarg3@huskers.unl.edu) if you have any questions.
